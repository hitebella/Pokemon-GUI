_Welcome to the Alola Region_ is a program that allows you to learn all about the 
many Pokémon of the Alola Region. By interacting with the GUI, you can

shorter than you, and see the stats of an Alolan type vs type Pokémon battle!

When you run the Main.java file, a window titled “Welcome to the Alola Region” 
should pop up.

- In the top section of this window, there is a drop-down box where you can 
select from 18 different Pokémon types, like water, fire, ice, grass, dark, etc.. 
There is text that says “Pokémon is the strongest Type type!” on the right side 
of the drop-down box. Depending on which Pokémon type you select, the 
system will replace “Pokémon” with the Pokémon that is the strongest of your 
selected type and “Type” with its type. For example, if you were to select “fairy” 
in the drop-down box, this should appear on the screen:
 						
 	               xerneas
               is the strongest 
                  fairy type!

- In the middle section of the window, there is a typing box that you can enter any 
integer number into. Once you type in a number and press enter on your 
keyboard, the screen will show you how many Pokémon are taller, shorter, or 
equal to the number you entered. These numbers should appear below the 
typing box in the underlined spaces. For example, if you were to type “3” into
the typing box, this should appear on the screen:


 	846 are taller
		        26 are shorter
				        77 are equal
				        
- In the bottom section of the window, there are two drop-down boxes. The box 
on the left is labeled “Type 1:” and the box on the right is labeled “Type 2:”. Both 
boxes contain all 18 different Pokémon types that you can select from. First, 
select a Pokémon type from the box on the left, then select another type from 
the box on the right. After you make these selections, the system will have all 
the Pokémon of type 1 battle all the Pokémon of type 2. The stats of these 
battles will appear on the right side of the screen next to the drop-down box 
labeled “Type 2:”. For example, if you select “fire” for Type1 and “fairy” for Type2, this should appear on the screen:	
    
    
    Type1 Wins:	624
    Type1 Losses:	485
    Type1 Ties:	12
    Type2 Wins:	485
    Type2 Losses:   624
    Type2 Ties:	12
